Multiple machine learning methods have been developed and trained to classify cases of Parkinson’s Disease. These methods exploit data about patients’ demographics, medical history, lifestyle, cognitive and functional capabilities, and common symptoms of the disease. Advanced data preprocessing was applied in the form of feature engineering, scaling, the synthetic minority oversampling technique, and principle component analysis. The culmination of these efforts is an ensemble learning model that combines the predictions of five different models to diagnose patients with an accuracy comparable to that of a professional clinician. Finally, to aid in future studies, a descriptive analysis is performed to determine how strongly related the attributes are to the diagnosis.
